Background
---------------
Some political committees report their contributions and expenditures to the IRS under ยง 527 of the U.S. tax code. The IRS publishes these disclosure forms as a bulk download. This app attempts to make sense of that archive.

The [archive](http://forms.irs.gov/app/pod/dataDownload/dataDownload) is updated every Sunday at 1:00 AM. 

Getting started
---------------

Install it.

```bash
$ pip install django-irs-filings
```

Add `irs` to your list of `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'irs',
    ...
)
```

Migrate your database.

```bash
$ python manage.py migrate irs
```

Finally, call the `updateIRS` command. This will download the latest zipped archive from the IRS website, unzip and parse it, and load it into the database.

```bash
$ python manage.py updateIRS
```
